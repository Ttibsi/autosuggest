# Autosuggest

A predictive-text algorithm in C11 using a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
data structure. The purpose of this project was to gain more experience with C
and some more complicated data structures that I've not used before.

Thanks to [rexim/tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding) for his
[arena.h](https://github.com/tsoding/arena) implementation
